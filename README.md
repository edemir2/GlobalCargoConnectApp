# GlobalCargo Connect

Welcome to the GitHub repository for GlobalCargo Connect, an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the exporting and importing processes for companies and traders globally. This project is part of the ISE 304 SW Engineering course at Istanbul Technical University.

## About the Project

GlobalCargo Connect facilitates efficient and reliable shipping services, bridging the gap between ship owners and customers worldwide. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly platform for seamless cargo transportation management.


### Current State of the Application

As of now, GlobalCargo Connect is in a prototype stage:
- **Visual Functionality**: The app has a working frontend with clickable buttons, leading users from one page to another, simulating real application flow.
- **Sample Data**: There are sample ship advertisements to give a general idea of how the app will function.
- **Backend Development**: The backend and database components are currently under development. Authentication and user login systems are not yet implemented.
- **Prototype Use**: This version serves as a conceptual demonstration, showcasing the potential functionality and interface of the final product.

### Future Prospects

With further development and potential investment, we aim to:
- Complete the backend and database integration.
- Implement robust authentication and user management.
- Enhance features based on user feedback and technological advancements.

### Features

- **User Authentication** (Planned): Secure login and account management.
- **Intuitive Application Interface**: Simplified user experience.
- **Shipment Request Management** (Planned): Manage and track shipment requests.
- **Transportation Matching** (Planned): Match requests with transportation services.
- **Robust Security** (Planned): Prioritize user data protection and system integrity.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (with Context API and State Hooks).
- **Backend**: Java (server-side operations in progress).
- **Data Handling**: JSON for client-server communication.
